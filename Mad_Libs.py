Once upon a time in planet "planet", lived a daring 5 years old "noun1" named "Name1". For one weekend, "Name1" together with 
his mother, father, and were invited to a huge gathering in a medium sized resort consisted of close friends, families, 
and some random "pronoun1". This resort had two "adjective1" swimming pools: one for young "noun1(plural)" that begins 
from zero to two feet deep, and the other pool for older and taller "noun1(plural)" that begins from 4 feet all the way up 
to "big integer" feet deep. "Name1" not usually having many chances to swim in a swimming pool, had lots of fun with 
other young "noun1 plural" playing tag.
