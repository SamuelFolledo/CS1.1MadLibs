Once upon a time in planet "planet", lived a daring 5 years old "noun1" named "Name1". For one weekend, "Name1" together with 
"his/her" lovely mother, father, and two sibings were invited to a huge gathering in a medium sized resort consisted of close friends, families, 
and some random "pronoun1". This resort had two "adjective1" swimming pools: one for young "noun1(plural)" that begins 
from zero to two feet deep, and another pool for the older and taller "noun1(plural)" that begins from 4 feet all the way up 
to "big integer" feet deep. "Name1" not usually having many chances to swim in a swimming pool, had lots of fun with 
other young "noun1 plural" playing tag. A few hours later as the night approached, "Name1" looked to "his/her" left at the other swimming
pool and saw how the older "noun1(plural)" were having so much fun. "He/She" thought to himself, why not me? So "Name1" tipped toe past the gazebo
full of people and made "his/her" way to the steps of the swimming pools. "Name1" carefuly took one step at a time while holding on tightly
the wall of the pool. With a huge grin on "his/her" face, "he/she" reached the last step of the pool where the water only reached all the way up to "his/her" chest. Curious on how deep
the last step was, "he/she" took one last step, which "he/she" found out was the tallest step that immediately put the water level just right above
"Name1"'s eye level. "He/she" tried to grab the edge but it was too far, "he/she" tried to retrack "his/her" steps, but it was too far and high. Lastly,
"he/she" tried to jump up to scream for help, but noone can hear him because "his/her" mouth was underneath the water. Jumping could only
do so little as water still flows down from "his/her" hair down to "his/her" face, removing "his/her" ability to breathe through "his/her" nose. "He/She" was 
however in peace to see everyone having fun, laughing, as the round-shape light of the lamp turns to diamond then to a straight line. 
Is this the end for the the daring and energetic "noun1" from planet "planet"?

A couple of minutes later, a "pronoun2" saw and decided to join the fun with other older "noun1" in the swimming pool. As he walks down the stairs
of the pool, he stepped on a little "noun1" who fully sank underneath the pool. Not knowing or caring who it was, he immediately took the "noun1" 
out of the pool and alerted everyone that someone drowned. Everyone had a curious and worried face and immediately rushed in to see who it was.
They saw a young "noun1" with a huge belly from all the water inhaled, purple from head to toe, and worst of all, with no heartbeat. The father
accompanied by a closed "pronoun1", immediately rushed to give his son a CPR. Not caring about the current repercussion and taste of the pool 
water mixed with "flavor" flavor from the inside of a dead "noun1", the father kept pumping and giving all his oxygen to his dead son. A couple 
of water removed and minutes passed, yet still no breathe nor heartbeat, but only discharges of waste from his rear bottom. After some prayers and 
cries from the observing concerned "pronoun1(plural)", the young "noun1" coughed out the remaining water. Still unconscious but this time, "he/she" 
was breathing and there was a heartbeat. 

The next morning, "Name1" found "himself/herself" in a new place, everything was mostly white, it was a hospital "he/she" slept at for the night. 
After a breakfast, "he/she" returned to the resort with the father, greeted everyone and noticed all eyes were glued on "him/her". Everyone 
looked at "him/her" differently, as "he/she" did looked different. This little five years old "noun1" went face to face and was victorious 
against a battle noone in the gathering has ever fought before nor dares to confront. "He/She" served as an insipration to everyone, that if 
"he/she" overcame death itself, they can too. "He/She" raised many eyebrows on what else is "he/she" meant to do? What else has God planned for "him/her"? That is too incomprehensible to know.
However, there is one thing "Name1" knows for sure, it is that "he/she" is meant to overcome any challenges "he/she" comes across. Now "Name1" is in
Make School to not simply get a degree, but to initialize a positive wave and dominate. To lead and be the best possible example for anyone 
"he/she" comes in contact with. Most importantly, to be unfazed and abide to what "he/she" believes is right. "His/her" curiousity will take him far,
but "his/her" imagination and positive attitude will take him further.
